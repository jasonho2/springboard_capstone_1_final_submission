# springboard_capstone_1_final_submission

This is my final submission for my first capstone project for Springboard's Data Science Career Track.

My goal is to predict the likelihood of a professional basketball player in the NBA to play in the league for 5 years based on their rookie statistics. Using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines, I examine the accuracy score generated by these machine learning algorithms and compare them to see which models will predict the classifier label (played in the league for at least 5 years) most accurately.

The main code is included in the final_code_submission notebook. The edits are in the final_code_submission-edits notebook. The rest of the notebooks were submitted in previous repositories.
